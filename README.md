# Emacs Modern

Emacs configuration files targeted __primarly__ at GUI Emacs versions >=29.

"Modern" features that are enabled:

- Smooth scrolling
- Popup autocomplete
- Personal keybindings, that don't give you RSI
- Quality of life improvements (similar to text editing in Notepad++, VS Code, etc.)
- ...

(list is not full, read the configuration files, please)

This configuration was only tested on Mac OS Monterey with Emacs-Plus 29 (with native comp).
